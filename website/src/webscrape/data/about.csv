My life always been about love, family, friends and sharing. I live in US with my husband and children. Well, I love being in the kitchen, whipping up tasty meals for my family and friends. I inherited my passion of cooking from my mom and I’m so proud to say that I was always been around with gifted cooks. I learnt cooking only after my marriage. When I was left alone in the kitchen when I came to US.  Yes, It took several years for me to learn the art of cooking. It was my hobby to collect the recipes of foods, I tasted and tried and in no time the list grew. One evening on our usual family get-together, my friends suggested of sharing and connecting with people through food, and learning new culinary ideas with people across the world…Isn’t it amazing? and that inspiration gave birth to this little space kothiyavunu.com. Thank you my friends."
7,"Recipes I share here come from various sources, some are my family recipes, some hail from my recipe collection, cookery shows, cookbooks, and some recipes are adapted or inspired from another food blogs and web sites, while others are my personal creations. I have mentioned the credit where it’s due. All recipes posted in this website are tried and tested in my kitchen and I have tried my best to give the correct measurements and the details for easy understanding. Since I hail from Kerala  the land of spices, my  taste buds are always in love with spicy dishes and my cooking palette are very much influenced from Kerala – South India, though I have expanded to cover all International recipes rather than just Indian cooking.  My love for food continued to grow…Happy Cooking!"
